**Activities**
Right, now let's put this stuff into practice. Have a go at the following:
•	Let's start by getting familiar with moving around. Use the commands cd and ls to explore what directories are on your system and what's in them. Make sure you use a variety of relative and absolute paths. Some interesting places to look at are:
o	/etc - Stores config files for the system.
o	/var/log - Stores log files for various system programs. (You may not have permission to look at everything in this directory. Don't let that stop you exploring though. A few error messages never hurt anyone.)
o	/bin - The location of several commonly used programs (some of which we will learn about in the rest of this tutorial.
o	/usr/bin - Another location for programs on the system.
•	Now go to your home directory using 4 different methods.
•	Make sure you are using Tab Completion when typing out your paths too. Why do anything you can get the computer to do for you?


**Activities**
Right, now let's put this stuff into practice. Have a go at the following:
•	Try running the command file giving it a few different entries. Make sure you use a variety of absolute and relative paths when doing this.
•	Now issue a command that will list the contents of your home directory including hidden files and directories.


**Activities**
Right, now let's put this stuff into practice. Have a go at the following:
•	Have a skim through the man page for ls. Have a play with some of the command line options you find there. Make sure you play with a few as combinations. Also make sure you play with ls with both absolute and relative paths.
•	Now try doing a few searches through the man pages. Depending on your chosen terms you may get quite a large listing. Look at a few of the pages to get a feel for what they are like.


**Activities**
We now have at our disposal, various commands to actually interact with the system. Let's put them into practice. Have a go at the following:
•	Start by creating a directory in your home directory in which to experiment.
•	In that directory, create a series of files and directories (and files and directories in those directories).
•	Now rename a few of those files and directories.
•	Delete one of the directories that has other files and directories in them.
•	Move back to your home directory and from there copy a file from one of your subdirectories into the initial directory you created.
•	Now move that file back into another directory.
•	Rename a few files
•	Next, move a file and rename it in the process.
•	Finally, have a look at the existing directories in your home directory. You probably have a Documents, Downloads, Music and Images directory etc. Think about what other directories may help you keep your account organised and start setting this up.
