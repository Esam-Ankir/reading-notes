# Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

1.	Running Time (also known as time efficiency/complexity)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.

2.	Memory Space (also known as space efficiency/complexity)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.


## Four Key Areas for Space and Time analysis:
### 1.	Input Size(n): more n more space and time.

### 2.	Units of Measurement: 
              A- for time: milliseconds, operations, Basic Operations
              B- for space: code for the algorithm, input, output, working space(Stack Space)

### 3.	Orders of Growth:  more n, Order of Growth represents more  Time or  Space:
 

***Constant Complexity  O(1)*** 

***Logarithmic Complexity O(lgn)***

***Linear Complexity O(n)***

***Linearithmic Complexity O(n*lgn)***

***Quadratic Complexity O(n^2) ex: nested loop***

***Cubic Complexity  O(n^3) ex: loop inside nested loop***

***Exponential Complexity O(2^n) like: fibonacci*** 

***Factorial Complexity O(n!)***


### 4.	Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case:
•	Big O: The worst-case 
•	Big Omega: The best-case 
•	Big Theta: The typical or random case
